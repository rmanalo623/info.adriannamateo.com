She will be performing solo at the American Museum of Natural History in April 2013.

In Summer 2013, she will be taking the project to Australasia.

						Ms. Mateo will be graduating in May 2013 (music performance major/French minor) from the Aaron Copland School of Music, where she recently performed Chausson's Po√®me for violin and orchestra as the winner of ACSM's 2012 concerto competition.
